# Medicine Details Extraction using NER

This AI-powered app revolutionizes the healthcare sector by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract medicine names and their active ingredients (salts) from medicine pamphlets. It employs Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify and extract critical details from the printed text. Leveraging tools like EasyOCR or Pytesseract, the app extracts text from medicine pamphlets and uses a custom NER parser to format the data for training.

The app is built with a custom-trained model using the spaCy library, which combines default and custom pipelines to optimize NER performance. Additionally, it integrates a voice-enabled AI chatbot for mental health support, powered by Alan AI, ensuring a comprehensive approach to healthcare.
